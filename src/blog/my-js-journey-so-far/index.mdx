I'll start by saying that it hasn't been pretty. It's been tough and at times feel like the mountain in front of me is getting taller and taller. 

I started learning JS through a bootcamp called NuCamp. NuCamp promised that within 6 months you'll be a full stack developer. The promise left me in the dark.
My struggle started early when I was trying to do my first project. Not only did I feel lost, I didn't know where to start. I felt like quiting because what is the point of being in a program that you aren't succedding in. 

NuCamp's curriculum is tightly packed and breezes through the core languages of the web to jump in frameworks. The first week of the course is learning HTML and CSS. The second and third week is dedicated to Javascript. I know, who can learn all the important concepts of Javascript in two weeks.
The course left many of the core javascript language concepts out. So making basic things like forms or navigation bars wasn't part of the course. The absolute basics of putting a website together was scrapped so that we can jump into Bootstrap. The course goes through Bootstrap, React and Redux, React Native and NodeJs.

Bootstrap handled most of the interactions we had while building NuCamp's tutorial driven website project. Core skills such as problem solving and understanding why and how certain things work were exchanged for instant gratifictation of seeing something you made online.
Bootstrap lasted about 2 or 3 weeks until we make the giant jump to React. If Javascript was the teacher in school you avoided, React then was the principle you ran away from. The react techniques we learned in NuCamp was primarily class based. Function components were only used for stateless components.

Progressing throught the react portion of the course was a drag. The bootstrap project was the same project we made for the react project. There were no differences between the two projects. NuCamp also did something weird were we would follow along the course then at some point the course wants you to refractor your code to a better way of using javascript and react.
It was confusing because how come NuCamp didn't try to give us those fundamentals from the jump? These are still questions that come up to my head. As soon as we hit the redux part, that is where I became completly diroriented in how things were working. I didn't truly understand the concepts of a provider and store and how that shipped data out to other react components. 
The lack of knowing how that works and even create one by myself really just spiraled me down the path of confusion even further. 

The React Native section was better because react native is similar to React. That simularity really helped me udnerstand React better but no where close to where I needed to be to eventually land a Job and freelance.
We created the same project again! However, this time we had the oppertunity to use APIs to talk to the phone's camera, storage and geolocation. That was pretty cool becuase I wanted to be a web developer to make my own freelance business so the geolocation was pretty cool.

The last portion of the course was focused on Nodejs. There really isn't much to discuss because we went over making our own little API but never learned from NuCamp how to connect it to your front end or host it somewhere. That project was a dud for me. At this point even though I had enough of NuCamp, I thought I was ready to quit programming. 

After the NuCamp course, I took a few months off of coding. Coding wasn't really in my head because I just felt I wasn't good enough. At some point during my break I wanted to jump back in again. I told myself that I wasn't going to quite or be sour on the fact of my NuCamp experience. I decided to begin my self study journey.
