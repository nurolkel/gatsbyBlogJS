Today is my first time blogging. I am a bit nervous because my writing is subpar. So one of my goals is to improve my writing through blogging. I will also be 
blogging about programming and the struggles learning programming. Save this website because you will laugh and learn while reading. 

Please let me know how I did. Tag me on twitter or instagram if you read this. I want to be able to speak to you and get feedback.
