I wanted to quit learning web development. I really felt I had no shot in becomming one. From my habits to my mentality I had all the signs of quting and feeling sorry for myself. 
I had to take a better approach because I know what I was doing then for my work wasn't making me feel happy nor fullfiled. I doubt more money or a better title would get me feeling appreciative of my work.
So I knew that programming was my path. 

One of my friends Pavel hooked me up with a web developer he knew named John. John was a nice guy and when we spoke for the first time, he gave me lots of confidence and the desire to continue on and learn more.
After speaking with John for the better part of two weeks, we decided that working together could benefit the both of us. This was in July. 

In the month of July, John had me basically do a bunch of work on wordpress with the different editors. It was fun for a bit but wordpress could be a bit boring to work with. 
After a few more conversations, we decided that we needed our own website. We decided to start programming our website with Wordpress. 

John and I would speak everyday and I was tasked to create our business website. I was working on the first one for a week or so and John had called me because he wanted to see the website's progress. I had liked the design I was making because It was simple yet had a luxury touch to it.
John had wanted something with a more brutalistic appearence. So I scrapped the website and started to work on that. Another week goes by and John then looks at the website and says we should change it one more time. This time he chose a theme that he purchased from Themeforest.net.

The theme was nice and simple yet had the brutalist style that John had liked. I kept working on the site and had everything and ready to go. John was looking at the copy and the style and wanted to change the content on the website. So I did what he requested and went ahead. At this point we didn't speak for a couple weeks. 
When we speak again, John wants to change direction completely. 

John wanted to go with the JAM stack instead of Wordpress. The static site generator we were using was 11ty. 11ty is pretty cool because it's basically plain javascript which is fun and simple on most websites. John had purchased a theme from themeforest again and I started plugging away at the build.
After a week and a half, the site was 90% done. The site only needed things like SEO and our pictures and a working contact form. We were ready to build our business and start getting new clients. I felt ready and was enthusatic becuase of all the possibilities that can come with a new business.
I was telling all my friends and family what I was working towards. 

To get extra practice with 11ty, I stared to build a website following a tutorial because I wanted to get the best practices from an expert. I got stuck at some point trying to figure out pagination. The docs on pagination wasn't helping me figure out the problem. I did what was layed out in the documentation and that still didn't work. That is when I discoved Gatbsyjs.
Gatsbyjs is exactly what I was looking for when I had originally thought about getting into freelancing. I knew some react but never in a million years think about giving a potential client a react file especially to a person who is not tech savy. Gatsbyjs made everything easier and gave me what I wanted to do, which is work with code. 

Gatsbyjs opened me up to making a small project called Slick's Slices. A fake static site getting data from sanity and using graphql in the frontend to generate that data. I was able to progress through and I wanted to create my own website called Performant Web. 
Performant Web was supposed to be released in the beginning of October. It's December 23rd now and it isn't done yet. It's not done for a couple reasons, I wanted to make it better and I wanted to become a better developer. So I figured it will be a good time to increase my Javascript skills and React Skills before I get into business and go out and get a career. 
It's been about three months so far and I will say that I am better than when I started. 

As much as I learn there is still a Mountain that is higher up that I have to climb but that is the journey of a learner and developer. We will never be able to know it all but through experience and failure and grit, we can achieve. My plan is that for the new year, I will have my resume and website completed. I will start making money again after almost 5 months without a job. I am blessed that I have supportive parents that let me follow my dreams.
